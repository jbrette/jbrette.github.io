## Goal

- Use the 3 nodes Raspeberry Cluster
- Access the WIFI, ZWave and Zigbee network
- Leverage the Nortek HUSBZB-1 Zwave and Zigbee dongle.
- Try to install [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [OpenHab](https://www.openhab.org/)

## First Issue

- [Home Assistant haas.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/) does not support Raspberry 3 B+ yet.
- haas.io is based on ResinOS. [ResinOS](https://resinos.io/#downloads-raspberrypi) is not using docker anymore but balena which does not support kubernetes yet.
