## How to setup your GOPATH

A lot of things seems to work much better if you edit your `.bashrc` to set GOPATH=$HOME.
The advantage of such a setup is that future "go get xxx" calls, will compile the go file into $HOME/bin which means
that new executable will be available without changing your PATH.
